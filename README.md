# Sample Electron App

### July 2023

This Hello World app is from the quick start tutorial on the Electron [website](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).


To run the application on your computer, after installing dependencies,
```angular2html
npm start
```

To package the application:
```angular2html
npx electron-forge import
npm run make
```

This will create the `out` folder where the package is located.
The `out` folder is not added to GitHub.
